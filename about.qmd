::: {#hero-heading}
Hi there! My name is **Denis Abdullin** and I am a Data Science Manager at Johnson & Johnson. I started my journey in Data Science in 2016 after a couple of years in master data and process automation. I created multiple internal packages helping data and business professionals to get insights from data.

My passion is building tools for **automated data analysis**, **natural language generation** systems, **time series** forecasting, building shiny modules and applications. I mostly code in R, but can also handle Python.

Here are some examples of my work:

-   [**narrator**](https://denisabd.github.io/narrator/ "Build text out of data with narrator") **-** template-based NLG system in R

-   [**async shiny**](https://github.com/denisabd/async_shiny "Use promises for scaling shiny applications") application using promises
