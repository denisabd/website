## The Idea

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(bslib)
```

```{r}
out <- paste0("
  \n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}
  \n knitr::kable(mtcars)
  \n```
  ")

cat(out)
```

After it we put this inline code at the end of the document, so that it actually knits `out` together with the other code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r paste(knitr::knit(text = out), collapse = '\n')`
```

This is what I did inside of this blog post, it actually works with both `rmarkdown` and `quarto`. This website is built with Quarto.

## Table Output

<!-- knit output elements -->

`r paste(knitr::knit(text = out), collapse = '\n')`
